Tagging is I think an important step when creating Azure Resources and we can and probably should
enforce tagging in our Azure subscriptions.

To enable enforcing tagging we can use Azure policies, you can read more about Azure policies in the link below: -

You can view in-built Azure policies at the following link : -
